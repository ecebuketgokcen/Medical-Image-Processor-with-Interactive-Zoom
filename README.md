 ### _**Medical Image Processor with Interactive Zoom**_


## üß†Project Description 

Medical Image Processor with Interactive Zoom & Focus Control is an advanced Python-based GUI application developed using PySide 6 and OpenCV. Designed specifically for medical image analysis, this application provides comprehensive image processing capabilities including grayscale conversion, edge detection, contrast enhancement, and interactive zoom functionality. The application features sophisticated focus control through mouse wheel interaction and includes CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) enhancement for improved lesion visibility in medical images.
Key innovations include real-time focus adjustment (sharpening/blurring), intelligent zoom with magnifier tool, and specialized medical imaging enhancements. The application maintains the original image in the main display while providing detailed analysis in separate interactive windows.

This project was developed as part of the Computational Methods in Engineering course at Ankara University, Department of Biomedical Engineering.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ecebuketgokcen/Medical-Image-Processor-with-Interactive-Zoom.git
cd Medical-Image-Processor-with-Interactive-Zoom
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install manually:
```bash
pip install PySide6 opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage

Run the application using: 
```bash
python main.py
```

**Basic Workflow:**
- **Load Image:** Click "Load Medical Image" to select a medical image from your computer  
- **Choose Enhancement:** Enable "CLAHE Enhancement" checkbox for better lesion visibility (optional)  
- **Apply Processing:** Use "Apply Grayscale", "Edge Detection", or "Enhance Contrast" buttons  
- **Adjust Parameters:** Use sliders to fine-tune brightness, contrast, and thresholds in real-time  
- **Interactive Analysis:**  
  - Focus Control: Scroll mouse wheel over processed image to adjust sharpness/blur  
  - Zoom Analysis: Left-click on any region to open magnified view (400x400 pixels)  
- **Save Results:** Click "Save Processed" to export processed version  

**Advanced Features:**
- **CLAHE Enhancement:** Toggle on for medical images with poor contrast  
- **Focus Levels:** -10 (maximum blur) to +10 (maximum sharpening)  
- **Zoom Area Control:** Adjust zoom region size before clicking for magnification  
- **Multi-Window Analysis:** Original stays in main window, zoom opens separately
