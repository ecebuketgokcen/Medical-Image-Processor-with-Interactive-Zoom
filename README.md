### _**Medical Image Processor with Interactive Zoom**_
Python + PySide6 + OpenCV


üß† **Project Overview**

This is a desktop application for basic medical image processing, allowing users to perform grayscale transformation, edge detection, brightness control, and interactive zoom-in functionality over images.

Developed using PySide6 (Qt for Python) and OpenCV, the application provides a clean and simple GUI for healthcare image exploration.


‚ú® **Features**

**Image Upload:** Load PNG, JPEG, and JPG images.

**Grayscale Conversion:** Convert colored images to grayscale with brightness adjustment.

**Edge Detection:** Detect edges using the Canny algorithm with user-controlled threshold sliders.

**Brightness Control:** Dynamically adjust image brightness using a slider.

**Interactive Zoom:**

Left-click on the image to display a zoomed-in region.

Use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out on the full image window.

Adjustable zoom area size with slider.

**Image Saving:** Save processed images in PNG or JPEG format.

üìù **Notes**

Ensure your system has a proper Python environment setup before running the application. If you encounter issues, check that all dependencies (such as PySide6 and OpenCV) are correctly installed.

This project was designed as part of the "Computational Methods in Engineering" course of Ankara University Biomedical Engineering department.It focuses on building a graphical interface for interactive medical image analysis using PySide6 and OpenCV.
